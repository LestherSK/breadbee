# Breadbee

A very small, 32mm x 30mm, ARM Cortex A7 development board that costs about ~$10
to make in low quantities and can be assembled at home with a cheap hot air rework
station. With a small adapter socket it can be mounted vertically in a standard breadboard.

## Features

These are features that are working:

- ~1GHz Cortex A7 CPU with NEON etc. Note MStar says it's 800MHz but their own cpufreq code says they clock it to 1GHz
- 64MB DDR2
- Bootable, memory mapped SPI-NOR
- 100Mbit ethernet.
- 4 x 10bit ADC channels
- 2 x SPI
- 1 x I2C (there is possibly one more)
- 3 or 4 UARTs (unsure if the pm_uart is the same as uart0) (max 2 or 3 usable at once due to pin muxing)
- Lots of GPIO. At least one with interrupt support.
- RTC
- WDT
- 3 x Timer
- 4 x PWM. Possibly 7

 The chip has a bunch of stuff in it that isn't supported yet:
 
 - SD/SDIO interface
 - USB
 - Camera interface, h264 encoder, mjpeg etc.
 - Audio ADC/DAC
 - Crypto engine that seems to be able to doã€€AES encrypted DMA transfers, memory mapped AES encryption etc
 - 8051 low power mode management MCU
 - Some sort of IR decoder that can wake the chip up based on the IR codes it sees.

## Software

Note that this is all in flux right at the moment. These repos are getting rebase'd fairly often.

### U-boot

There is a basic port of u-boot that so far take over from the MStar IPL and load a kernel from the SPI NOR, write it etc.
See boot process below for more details.

### Kernel

All of the above features work to some degree.

### Buildroot

Combines the u-boot and kernel above with a root filesystem and generates flashable images.

### Test Points

- The audio pins are broken out to a series of test points on the left side of the parts size of the board.
- pm_irin is broken out to a test point on the ethernet jack side of the board.

## Using JTAG

JTAG is enabled at boot up on the spi0 pins by the u-boot SPL.

## Boot process

The standard MStar boot process is like this:
- Start the boot rom that is baked into the chip
- Load the "IPL" from SPI NOR into internal SRAM
- Jump into the IPL
- The IPL then does DRAM setup and tries to load "IPL_CUST" from SPI NOR or somewhere else if that fails
- IPL_CUST does a bunch of higher level stuff and then loads an XZ compressed u-boot image into DRAM and starts it

The ideal boot process would be:

- Start the boot rom that is baked into the chip
- Load the u-boot SPL
- u-boot SPL does DRAM setup and loads the main u-boot from SPI NOR into DRAM and starts it.

Unfortunately the DRAM setup process isn't understood yet. So the actual boot process is:

- Start the boot rom that is baked into the chip
- Load the IPL
- Trick the IPL into loading the u-boot SPL as IPL_CUST into DRAM (IPL_CUST is limited to 64K so we still need the SPL)
- SPL loads the main u-boot and starts it.
